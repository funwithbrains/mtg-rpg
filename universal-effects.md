## Universal Effects

If a player creature is not wounded, treat damage it takes as if that player creature were only a creature. (Usually, it loses no life. Marked damage is removed at the end of turn, as usual.)

If a player creature is wounded, treat damage it takes as if that player creature were only a player. (Usually, it loses life equal to the damage taken. Abilities like infect may add poison counters.)

Player creatures cannot be sacrificed.

If a player creature would be exiled or would die because of a destroy effect or because its damage equals or exceeds its toughness, instead it becomes wounded. Then it takes damage equal to the amount by which its marked damage exceeds its toughness. (This damage must be treated as if the player creature is only a player.)

If a permanent would enter the battlefield as or would become a copy of a player creature, instead it becomes a creature. (It has only the stats a creature would normally have. It has no spells, but it does copy any activated abilities on the player creature. It copies name, subtypes, power, and toughness.)

Whenever a wounded player creature is controlled by a player other than its owner, its owner gains control of it.

If you would untap lands during your untap step, instead untap a number of lands up to your rejuvenation.

Whenever you control a number of non-land, non-player-creature permanents greater than your concentration, sacrifice a non-land, non-player-creature permanent. Split-second. (Lands, artifacts, enchantments, creatures, and planeswalkers on the battlefield are permanents.)

Whenever you control a number of lands greater than your level, sacrifice a land.

Whenever your mana pool contains an amount of mana greater than your mastery, pay {X}, where X is the difference, and you lose X life. Split-second.

Whenever you take a channeling action, put a fatigue counter on yourself. Split-second.

If the number of fatigue counters on you equals or exceeds your channeling, you cannot take any channeling actions.

At the beginning of your untap step, remove all fatigue counters from yourself.

Your life cannot exceed your maximum life.

You have a maximum hand size equal to your memory.

If you would draw your starting hand, instead draw a number of cards equal to your memory.

If you would cast a spell or activate an activated ability, instead do the following:

> * If you do not have a reaction speed value, make a speed roll. The result becomes your reaction speed value until the stack becomes empty.
> * You may cast your chosen spell or activate your chosen activated ability only if either the stack is empty or your reaction speed roll exceeds the reaction speed roll associated with the controller of the topmost spell or activated ability on the stack. (If you do not cast a spell or activate an activated ability, you are not required to announce which spell you would have cast or which activated ability you would have activated. Triggered abilities trigger as usual. They do not interact with any speed rolls.)

Effects in card text override these effects.
