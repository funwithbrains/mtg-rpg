## Making a Character

To make a character, first come up with a concept. If you just want to play a single encounter, you only need to figure out your character's style. If you want to play a whole campaign you'll need to give your character a story. (For now, we'll assume that you know how to give your character a story from your prior experience with other table-top RPGs. If you do not have such experiences, we encourage you and your friends to give it a try with a system that has already been thoroughly tested.)

Once you know your character's style, you can choose their stats, their abilities, and their deck. This file is here to help you make those choices.

----

### Stats

Your stats determine what your options will be in combat. When choosing stats, it's good to have an idea of what cards you want in your deck.

#### Level

Your level is determined by your GM. This is the stat that roughly measures your battle ability. Gaining a level gives you the build points needed to raise other stats, and it increases the number of lands you can put into play at the start of the game.

#### Color Identity

Your color identity determines what colors of spells you can include in your deck. It also has some other effects, which you can see elsewhere in these rules.

#### Maximum Life

This is the amount of life you have at the start of battle. It is also the upper limit for your life total. Unlike regular *Magic,* these rules do not allow your life total to rise without limit.

#### Power

Your power stat is the very same power stat that you see on creature cards.

#### Toughness

Like power, your toughness stat is a creature stat, and it comes into play when you use yourself like a creature.

#### Mastery

Your mastery determines the maximum size of your mana-pool. You won't be able to cast spells bigger than your mastery, unless they allow you to pay alternative costs.

#### Rejuvenation

Your rejuvenation determines how many lands you can untap at the start of your turn. Unlike regular *Magic,* it takes time to replenish your mana.

#### Concentration

Your concentration determines how many permanents you can control.

#### Channeling

Your channeling determines how many spells you can cast and how much you can use your permanents each turn.

#### Speed

Your speed determines which effects you can and cannot react to. It can also help you strike first in battle, if you use the right ability.

#### Focus

Your focus makes it easier to draw a predictable hand. It does this by reducing the size of your library.

#### Memory

Your memory lets you hold more cards in hand. It also determines the size of your starting hand.
